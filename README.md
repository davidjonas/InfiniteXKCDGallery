# InfiniteXKCDGallery
A very simple unity project that creates an infinite virtual 3D gallery of the awesome XKCD comics. Made as an example. 

## Why?

This project was made as an example for something I needed. And it is just what it is supposed to be. It took me about an hour and a half to make including 3D modeling a bunch of things that I discarded in the end. So why not share it? If you are looking for an example of how to call API's from Unity or load textures from online sources then go ahead and have a look at the code. It's simple and small. And public domain, do whatever you want with it.

## XKCD

[XKCD](https://xkcd.com/) is a legendary geek web comic and it deserves a to be in a gallery. Go check out the website and support however you can.
